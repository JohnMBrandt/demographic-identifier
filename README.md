# demographic-identifier
Computer vision and NLP to identify age, race, and gender in photographs

## Installation

This Python + R toolkit requires a Python 3.6 virtual environment. The dependencies can be installed with 

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The R requirements `tidyverse`, `gender`, `plyr`, and `jsonlite` can be installed with

```
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'gender', 'plyr', 'jsonlite'))
```
## Methodology
#### Input
The input data should be in the form of a compressed streaming json file returned from the Twitter API. 

#### Code
The `download_data.R` file will identify all the user profile images from the API results and download every image to the `img` folder. When run in order, the `age-gender-image.py`, `process_results.R`, and `calc_gender_age.R`, scripts will return a CSV in the `results` folder that contains the twitter handle and associated estimated age and gender.

Ethnicity is estimated using the Python package [ethnicolr](https://github.com/appeler/ethnicolr) which uses character-level RNN to predict race from first and last name. After install, ethnicity can be estimated using the following bash script

```
pred_wiki_name -o ../results/stream_05/output-wiki-pred-race.csv -l last.name -f first.name ../results/stream_05/results_gender_age.csv
```

#### Model architectures

Gender is estimated using a combination of computer vision and U.S. census data. The `gender` [R package](https://github.com/ropensci/gender) matches first names to gender proportions in the U.S. census. Gender and age were also estimated using a [pre-trained](https://github.com/yu4u/age-gender-estimation) [WideResNet architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146.pdf) network trained on 500,000 photographs labelled by age and gender. 

The mean error is 3 years for age, and the accuracy rate for gender is 95%. These estimates are validated by matching the name, when available, to US census data on gender percentiles by first name. In more than 95% of cases, these two estimates match. When they do not, the highest confidence estimate is used as the gender prediction. Pairing these two modes of estimating gender allows an estimate where only one of the two data sources are available (User image containing a face, or first name). 

#### Semantics and topics

Differences in semantics between demographic groups can be modelled with [neural variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06038) or sentence embeddings that do not rely on continuous sentences, such as [doc2vec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf). With large amounts of training data, semantics may be modelled by taking the l2 norm of the summation of word level multilingual embeddings, such as [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE).
